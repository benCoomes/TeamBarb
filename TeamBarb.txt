Submission Summary:

The folder contains several diagrams beginning to outline the concept for our team's fitness application,
GetFit, which takes a user's schedule and daily habits and proposes suggested workouts that fit into
the user's busy day, hopefully helping more people to "find the time" for being active and staying healthy.
